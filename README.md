### FIND NEW PLACES TO EXPLORE. 

### It's easy to get information for places you already know about... but how do you find the hidden gems you've never heard of? 

> Whether you're a digital nomad, traveller, or road tripper, Dinofii helps you discover new destinations. Define your search area as either Earth, a country, or region of a country, then choose the type of place you're looking for from the Select Feature menu.

> When you click Search, Dinofii will randomly return a matching feature in the search area you defined, as well as the closest city to that feature. Every piece of information returned is linked to more information.

> The feature name, country name, and feature type are all linked to search for more information about themselves. The feature's latitude and longitude coordinates will take you to a map of that location. The closest city information will take you to a map with directions from the city to the feature. The wifi icon will display the number of hotspots found in the area if that information is available, and the globe icon next to the wifi symbol will take you to a map of all known wifi hotspots in the area.

> Happy trails!
